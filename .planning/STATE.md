# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-05)

**Core value:** Discover and read recent Nostr long-form articles, filtered by hashtag — with zero backend, served as a static GitHub Pages site.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — nostr-data-layer

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-06-07

Progress: [██████████░░] 40% (Phase 1 + 02-01 + 02-02 complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: nostr-tools SimplePool chosen over NDK (bundle size) and applesauce (RxJS overhead)
- Roadmap: Deploy-first ordering — Phase 1 establishes live Pages URL so all later work is verifiable there
- Roadmap: Data layer isolated to Phase 2 before any UI consumes it — relay risks contained to one phase
- 01-02: Vite base corrected to /soveng/ — repo is gsovereignty/soveng (project-subpath), not gsovereignty.github.io (root-page)
- 01-02: GitHub Actions artifact deploy (upload-pages-artifact + deploy-pages) over gh-pages npm package
- 01-02: SPA 404 fallback via postbuild npm script (node -e copyFileSync build/index.html build/404.html)
- 01-02: Build outDir set to build/ (gitignored) per user request to keep repo root clean
- 02-01: SimplePool at module scope in lib/pool.ts — never in React state (StrictMode-safe)
- 02-01: nostr-tools subpath imports only (/pool, /kinds, /core) — root barrel forbidden for tree-shaking
- 02-01: Freeze guard before dedup guard in ARTICLE_RECEIVED reducer (size check is outer gate)
- 02-01: AppShell child component pattern — lives inside NostrProvider so useNostr() works
- 02-01: PROFILE_RECEIVED is pass-through no-op for now; implemented in Plan 02
- 02-02: PROFILE_RECEIVED newest-wins uses strict > (not >=) per Pitfall 4
- 02-02: Single batched subscribeMany for all ≤21 pubkeys (D-09); no per-author sub
- 02-02: pubkeys.join(',') as stable useEffect dep avoids array identity churn
- [Phase ?]: 02-03: Plain button with terminal tokens for retry control
- [Phase ?]: 02-03: error vs empty branch messages are distinct static literals (D-06 error/empty distinction)
- [Phase ?]: 02-03: RESET clears seenCoords — Pitfall-3 regression guard closes stale-coord starvation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 planning flag: relay EOSE timeout tuning and batch kind:0 query limits need validation against live relays (see research SUMMARY.md)
